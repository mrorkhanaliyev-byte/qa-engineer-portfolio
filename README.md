# QA Engineer Portfolio

> End-to-end Quality Assurance portfolio demonstrating the **full QA lifecycle** on real-world e-commerce applications — from manual test design and bug reporting through API testing, database validation, and UI automation across multiple frameworks.

## About This Portfolio

This repository documents my work as a **QA Engineer** testing two e-commerce applications end-to-end:

- **[Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/)** — full e-commerce flow (UI + REST API)
- **[SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/)** — Swag Labs storefront (UI focus)

Each section covers a distinct QA discipline. Together they tell one story: **a tester who can design coverage, find bugs, communicate them clearly, and prevent regressions through automation.**

---

## What's Inside

| # | Section | Focus | Tech |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | [Manual Testing](./01-manual-testing/) | Test plans, test cases, bug reports, checklists | Excel, Markdown |
| 02 | [Jira Workflow](./02-jira-workflow/) | Sprint boards, bug lifecycle, dashboards | Jira |
| 03 | [SQL Queries](./03-sql-queries/) | Data validation queries, joins, window functions | SQL |
| 04 | [API Testing](./04-postman-api-testing/) | REST API collections, env variables, CI runs | Postman, Newman |
| 05 | [Cypress E2E](./05-cypress-tests/) | UI automation, Page Object Model | Cypress, JavaScript |
| 06 | [Playwright E2E](./06-playwright-tests/) | Cross-browser automation, fixtures | Playwright, TypeScript |
| 07 | [Selenium Framework](./07-selenium-java/) | Hybrid framework, TestNG, Page Objects | Selenium, Java, Maven |

Each section has its own README with run instructions and screenshots.

---

## Highlights

- **65 manual test cases** covering login, registration, search, cart, and checkout flows
- **3 documented bug reports** with reproduction steps, severity, environment, and impact analysis
- **Smoke + regression checklists** with P0/P1/P2 prioritization
- **Jira workflow** — custom bug-lifecycle diagram (Mermaid), 15+ JQL queries grouped by daily use case, drag-droppable CSV that imports the bug reports as real Jira tickets
- **Cypress E2E framework** with Page Object Model and Mochawesome reporting — 6 specs across 4 sites (Demoblaze, Automation Exercise login+cart, ABB Bank, Tap.az), **50 test cases** including real Azerbaijani banking and e-commerce production sites
- **Postman + Newman API suite** — full coverage of Automation Exercise's 14 documented endpoints (45+ assertions), with a chained user-lifecycle scenario that cleans up after itself
- **SQL validation suite** — SQLite e-commerce schema, 19 queries (basic / joins / subqueries / window functions / QA validation), 5 intentionally planted data-quality bugs that the validation queries surface, runs in <10s
- **Playwright cross-browser suite** in **TypeScript** — runs the same login + cart flows as Cypress on **Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari)** in a parallel CI matrix; Trace Viewer artifacts on failure
- **Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)** with `@axe-core/playwright` — 7 page audits across AE + Demoblaze, baseline-as-regression-gate so CI catches a11y debt growing without failing on every minor warning; full findings documented in [`AUDIT-RESULTS.md`](./06-playwright-tests/AUDIT-RESULTS.md)
- **GitHub Actions CI** runs Cypress, Playwright (×3 browsers), Newman, AND SQL on every push, uploads reports as artifacts, and shows four live green badges in this README

## How to Run

Each automation framework has its own setup instructions in its folder. Quick start:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mrorkhanaliyev-byte/qa-engineer-portfolio.git
cd qa-engineer-portfolio

# Run Cypress tests
cd 05-cypress-tests
npm install
npx cypress run

# Run Playwright tests
cd ../06-playwright-tests
npm install
npx playwright test

# Run API tests with Newman
cd ../04-postman-api-testing
newman run collections/automation-exercise-api.postman_collection.json
```
